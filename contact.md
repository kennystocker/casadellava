Getting there and away
----------------------

[![](/images/map-general-preview.gif)](map-big.php "Click to enlarge")

The closest airports are at Milan. Choose from either [Linate](http://www.sea-aeroportimilano.it) or [Malpensa airport](http://www.malpensairport.com) or [Bergamo airport](http://www.orioaeroporto.it/Airpor/portalProcess.jsp?languageID=2) (Orio al serio). It takes roughly 90mins to reach the house (slightly longer from Malpensa). The fastest route is to take the ss36 dual carriageway from Lecco to Colico along the Eastern shore of Lake Como, through an amazing series of tunnels.

We are big fans of Lake Como and we often stop at Bellano or Varenna for a lakeside pizza. You can also take the car ferry across Lake Como from Varenna to Menaggio if you want to take the slower road on the west of the lake. The ferry journey itself is beautiful. You can also call in at places like Villa Carlotta if you want a longer break.

You can get to Chiavenna from Milan reasonably easily by train - [Trenitalia](http://www.trenitalia.it)

On Arrival
----------

You have to walk about 200m from the car to the house so we recommend you bring suitcases you can carry. You will be met on arrival and shown to the house. You can download the [arrival instructions](/images/arrival.pdf) as a PDF.

Useful Info
-----------

*   Bars - The bar in Pianazzola is a good place for a coffee or beer and catch up with the local gossip. Also to ask your way round. The owners also live there and you may well find yourself in their kitchen! They are v friendly, but you'll need to talk Italian (or dialect) to them. They don't generally serve food, but there's no hard and fast rule. Otherwise head to Chiavenna
*   Shops/Supermarket - As well as the shops in the centre of town, there is a hypermarket (Iperal) on the right as you enter Chiavenna from the South (turn right just after the first roundabout as you enter the town). It sells food and pretty much everything else
